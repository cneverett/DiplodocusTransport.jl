    ElectromagneticFieldGrid(Spacetime,tetrad,Grids)

Returns the average values of the magnetic and electric fields within a given spatial grid cell (x_index,y_index,z_index) as measured by an observer associated with the `tetrad`, which also defines the type of field. Returning two arrays for the magnetic field B(x_index,y_index,z_index) and electric field E(x_index,y_index,z_index) respectively. Note: this is currently only defined for "force-free" tetrads the **magnetic is measured with respect to the orthonormal observer frame of the tetrad** and is taken to be along the local momentum z-direction and the electric field is zero. Tetrads that allow an E parallel to B will be implemented in the future.
