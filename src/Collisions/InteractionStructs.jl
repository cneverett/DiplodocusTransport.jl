A struct to contain information pertaining to a particular emissive interaction. 
# Fields
- `name1::String`: name of incoming particle (absorbed)
- `name2::String`: name of outgoing particle 1 (emitted)
- `name3::String`: name of outgoing particle 2 (emitted)
- `EmiName::String`: name of the emissive interaction e.g. "Sync" for synchrotron radiation
- `Ext_sampled::Vector{Float64}`: vector of sampled values of the external parameter for which the emissive interaction matrices are built e.g. sampled magnetic field values for synchrotron radiation
- `mode::AbstractMode`: mode of the emissive interaction e.g. "Iso", "Axi" or "Ani"
- `Force::Bool`: if name1==name2 the emissive interaction may be treated as reactive force e.g. radiation reaction for synchrotron. In which case this force can be applied directly, within the emission matrix or separately as a regular force.
- `Domain::Union{Vector{Int64},Nothing}`: vector of spatial indices (offset_space) referring to spatial sub-domains in which to apply the emissive interaction. If `nothing` the interaction will be applied to all spatial sub-domains.
